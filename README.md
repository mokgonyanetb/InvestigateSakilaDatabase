# Investigate a Relational Database
This is one of the prerequisite projects in Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python.

## Sakila DVD Rental database
In this project, we are querying the Sakila DVD Rental database that holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. 
We are querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, 
how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance. [For more click here](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-getting-started/postgresql-sample-database/).

## Business Questions
Here are the questions
1. Which category under family movies has been rented out the most?
2. Which category has generated the most revenue?
3. Which top 10 countries have the most customers?
4. Who are the Top 10 customers who have spent the most on rentals and from which countries are these customers from?

_The queries and visualisations we have used in answering these questions are attach to this repo_
_The Sakila database's ERD diagram is attached to this repo_

## Project Rubric
* All SQL queries run without errors and produce the intended results.
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more explicit JOINs. The JOIN or JOINs should be necessary to the query.
* Each SQL query needs to include one or more aggregations. This could be a COUNT, AVG, SUM, or other aggregation.
* At least 2 of the 4 SQL queries need to include either a subquery OR a CTE.
* At least 1 of the 4 queries should use a Window Function.
* The SQL queries are well formatted and use aliases.
